Two examples of Draggable Components(Boxes) in React Native. They are from the official website(documentation), and they both support Web as well as iOS and Android.

## Examples
If the previews of Expo Snacks are not shown, it is due to width limitation. Please view it in a seperate window by clicking the icon located on the right of the Snack's title.

### Drag and Stay
